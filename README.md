Brokion's Last Stand is a small missile defender game being built in Unity 3.

This is a small project written primarily in C#, and designed/configured/built in Unity 3.

Unfortunately I've been too busy to finish this thing, but eventually the plan is to release it for iOS, Android, and probably Kongregate.
